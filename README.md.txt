# Autobot Project

This project is a modified Arduino smart robot car built for CS 207 / CTCH 223. 
We upgraded a basic robot kit by adding:

- Obstacle avoidance
- Bluetooth control
- Future GPS tracking with a custom 3D-printed mount
- Cleaner wiring and code design
- Personal documentation to show how the system works

All code and documentation for this project will be inside this folder.
