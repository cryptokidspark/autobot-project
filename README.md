Autobot Project

The Autobot Project is a modified Arduino-based smart robot car built for the CS 207 / CTCH 223 course.  
The goal is to transform a basic robot car kit into a miniature version of a real autonomous system — capable of sensing, navigating, communicating, and being expanded with new technologies such as GPS and voice control.

This repository contains all code, documentation, notes, hardware designs, and development logs for the project.

Project Overview

The Autobot is designed as a small-scale model of modern autonomous vehicles and delivery robots.  
It uses an Arduino microcontroller as its “brain” and combines several technologies:

- **Obstacle avoidance** using an ultrasonic sensor  
- **Manual remote control** through Bluetooth  
- **Movement control** using a motor driver and directional logic  
- **Future GPS module integration** mounted on a custom 3D-printed tower  
- **Expandable design** for voice commands and environmental sensing

The purpose of this project is to understand how real-world autonomous systems gather information, make decisions, and navigate safely in their environment.

Goals of the Project

1. Build a robot car that can drive and avoid obstacles.  
2. Add a custom 3D-printed mount for a GPS receiver and track location in real time.  
3. Implement Bluetooth control to steer the robot wirelessly.  
4. Add basic voice commands (future work).  
5. Demonstrate how small prototypes relate to large-scale technologies like:  
   - Self-driving cars  
   - Delivery robots  
   - Mobile IoT systems  
   - Smart city devices
