Introduction
Technology is becoming one of the biggest forces shaping modern life, and robotics is at the center of this change. Every year, more industries rely on robots to complete tasks that require precision, consistency, and safety. We see examples of this everywhere such as delivery robots rolling across sidewalks, machines sorting packages in warehouses, smart cars scanning their surroundings, and drones assisting with search and rescue. These systems may look complex on the outside, but at their core, they rely on simple ideas. They sense their environment, process information, and react based on what they learn.
Our project, the Autobot, was created to explore these ideas using a hands-on approach. Instead of only reading about autonomous systems, we wanted to build a small version of one. The goal was to create a robot car that can move, detect obstacles, follow commands, and leave room for future upgrades like GPS tracking and voice control. Even though the Autobot is small, the concepts behind it are the same ones used in full-size autonomous vehicles. It uses sensors to understand distance, motors to move in different directions, and code to control its decisions.
Working on this project gave us the chance to understand how separate components such as the ultrasonic sensor, motor driver, Bluetooth module, and microcontroller come together to form a complete system. It also introduced us to the importance of problem solving, testing, and redesigning. Sometimes the robot behaved exactly how we expected, and sometimes it did not, but every problem helped us learn more about how robots think and act. By the end, we did not just assemble a robot car. We gained a clearer understanding of how real world technology, such as self driving cars and delivery robots, is built from simple building blocks that anyone can learn to work with.
