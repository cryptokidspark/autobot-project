Inspiration
The inspiration for the Autobot came from watching how robotics is becoming part of everyday life. When we see small delivery robots navigating sidewalks or hear about self driving cars learning to make decisions, it raises the question of what allows a machine to sense the world and move safely. Instead of only being curious, we wanted to explore those ideas by building something ourselves. A robot car project felt like the perfect place to start because it allowed us to combine creativity, coding, engineering, and problem solving all at once.
Another reason we chose this project is that robotics encourages teamwork and innovation. Every member of our group brought different skills, and this project pushed us to combine them. Kunal handled most of the physical assembly and wiring of the robot. Emmanuel worked on the C++ code and made sure the sensors and movements responded correctly. Nico coordinated the group, kept everyone organized, and made sure tasks were completed on time. Param focused on research and testing, helping us compare ideas and troubleshoot problems. Bamise supported the documentation and presentation work and helped turn our technical progress into clear explanations. Together, these roles allowed the project to come together smoothly and successfully. We discussed ideas, solved mechanical issues, organized wiring, wrote code, and tested the robot as a team. Whenever something went wrong, such as the wheels not turning correctly or the sensor not giving accurate distance readings, it reminded us how real engineers adjust, redesign, and try again. The process became just as important as the final result.
We were also inspired by the idea of expanding the project beyond the basics. Many school robot cars only move forward and backward, but we wanted ours to represent something more meaningful. Adding features like obstacle avoidance, Bluetooth control, and especially a custom 3D printed mount for a GPS module allowed us to imagine how real autonomous systems evolve. The GPS mount, for example, symbolizes how delivery robots and autonomous vehicles rely on accurate positioning to navigate through cities. Knowing that even a student built project can reflect real world ideas made the Autobot feel special.
Most of all, the inspiration came from wanting to build something that teaches us new skills while also connecting to the future of technology. Robotics is not only about wires and code. It is about creativity, curiosity, and the desire to solve problems in new ways. Building the Autobot gave us the chance to experience that firsthand, and it showed us how much potential there is when you take an idea and turn it into something that moves, reacts, and interacts with the world around it.
